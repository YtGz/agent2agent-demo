   - Analyzes real-time market data
   - Generates buy/sell signal
   - Sends signal to Risk Agent via A2A

2. **Risk Agent** evaluates trade
   - Receives signal from Market Agent
   - Analyzes current portfolio risk
   - Calculates position size
   - Sends approval/rejection to Execution Agent via A2A

3. **Execution Agent** processes trade
   - Receives approved trade from Risk Agent
   - Places order through Alpaca Paper Trading API
   - Monitors order execution
   - Sends confirmation to Reporting Agent via A2A

4. **Reporting Agent** updates metrics
   - Receives trade confirmation from Execution Agent
